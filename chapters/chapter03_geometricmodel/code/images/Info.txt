king queen jack image
======================

width x height pixels
---------------------
Each card is   656 x 1012 pixels 

In physical units real cards are 
89 mm (height) = 1012 pixels
64 mm = (1012/89)*64 = 728 pixels


Calculation of sensor dimensions for image simulation
-----------------------------------------------------
* Paraxial magnification = 0.02459016393 @ object 1000 mm away from lens vertex in sharp focus

* Least dimension of sensor = 4.54 x 3.46 mm (width by height)

* Largest image: at OBJ distance of 800 mm (thickness = 760), the magnification is |0.0309|, therefore, the minimum sensor size = 2.8 mm by 6 mm.

These images are evidences that the Zemax image simulation tool produces 
blocky artifacts. Location of these blocks artifacts doesn't seem to depend "Image Sampling"
setting. However, the location changed when I set the aberration type to diffraction.
Also, this problem exist even in the new OpticStudio 15.5.

The main cause of this artifact seems to be the pixel size of the detector, when it is
defined -- the blocks are not apparent if the detector pixel size is equal to the object 
pixel size * transverse_magnification. If the blocks are very prominant if the set detector
pixel size is larger than this ( object_pixel_size * transverse_magnification) value.

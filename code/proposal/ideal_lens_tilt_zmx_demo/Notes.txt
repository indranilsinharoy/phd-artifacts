Procedure to use this file:
1. Adjust the thickness of the surface "Dist. from last lens surf. to IMG" with all planes parallel: 
   (a) Set the tilt angles for the CB to '0'; 
         (a.1)  Change the focal length (if required); 
         (a.2) use Quick Adjust to adjust the thickness; [or even put M solve on the thickness]
   (b) Remove the solve for the thickness; Then set the angle of the image plane i.e. tilt X of "CB surf to tilt IMG"; 
   (c) Optimize

Note: Although the above procedure will work, a cleaner way is: 
(a) Set the tilt angles for the CB to '0'; 
(b) Remove the solve for the angle on CB; 
(c) add variable solve on the thickness  of the surface "Dist. from last lens surf. to IMG" and optimize for the RMS spot size; 
(d) remove the solve for the thickness, apply solve for the PSF tilt and set IMG tilt angle. 
(e) optimize

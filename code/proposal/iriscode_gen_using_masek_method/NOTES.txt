1. How can I compare the Python code vs. Masek's Matlab code??
-- One possibility is to measure the maximum and mean hamming distace between the iris code (templates) generated by the two programs for the iris images in a given database (more appropriately the databased used by Masek

2. Implement the imporovement proposed by "Experiments with An Improved Iris Segmentation Algorithm" by Xiaomei Liu, Kevin W. Bowyer, and Patrick Flynn.

</div>
<p>The following figure shows the back of the board that was updated on 09.10.14. In the first construction, there used to a cylindrical rod end to end. However, that allowed to board to tilt a little (with the joints between the board and the rod as pivot points) even when the rod was tightly secured and didn’t rotate. Replacing the rod with a flat rail improved the design further and the above described undesirable tilts didn’t happen.</p>

<p><strong>[Update: 09.11.14]</strong></p>
<p>Note that in the current (and previous) design, the actual axis of rotation of the tablet is slightly displaced from the line joining the hinges (actual axis of rotation). Perhaps an even better design could be something like the following. In this case the target’s rotation axis can be exactly aligned to the hinges.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It is very evident from the above images, that the camera was not properly focused on the target. The blur is very clear in “PSF_Measurement_9_3_1”. In “PSF_Measurement_9_3_2”, the blur spot is smaller because of the use of smaller (f/32) aperture. Clearly, geometric effects are more evident than diffraction effects.</li>
<li>The images are also very noisy (lack of enough light)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="rectification-strategy">Rectification strategy</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We must come up with a better way to focus. Using the “bar indicator” of CaptureShop for focusing is not sufficient.</li>
<li>It seems that it is not necessary to perform the experiment at f/32. Most likely an aperture setting of f/16 or f/11 should be good enough for observing the nature of the PSF across the image plane.</li>
<li>For exposure setting, use at least 2 seconds, and ISO 100 for f/8. For f/11 and/or f/16 verify if the exposure is good enough with 4 seconds exposure, and with ISO 100.</li>
<li>Need to do dark-frame subtraction.</li>
<li>Should probably decrease the object distance by moving the camera forward. What about a distance of about 3 meters?</li>

<h4 id="method-to-ensure-the-image-plane-lens-plane-object-plane-are-parallel">Method to ensure the image plane, lens plane &amp; object plane are parallel</h4>
<p>At the start of the experiment, we need to ensure that the target plane, the lens plane and the sensor plane are parallel to each other. The lens plane and the image plane orientation can be set using the manual adjustment knows in the Sinar camera. In order make all the planes parallel, we mounted a small laser diode on an aluminum plane (see figures of contraption below), which was machined to fit appropriately on to the image standard. Another plastic plate, which was 3D printed, was attached to the front standard in place of the lens, and a diffuser alignment disk was attached at the center of the plate (see the figure). The configuration was such that the laser light would pass through the small hole in the center of the alignment disk only when the centers of the two standards were aligned. Then, the laser light path represented the virtual optical axis. Now, a small mirror was placed on the target surface that reflected the laser light back towards the camera. The orientation of the target plane was adjusted until the reflected laser light traced the incident path exactly.</p>
<p>We also used the same laser point to place the target’s center approximately near the optical axis.</p>
<p>The following images show the various contraptions made for the experiment:</p>

<p>I bought a pack of cheap 4x4 inch mirrors from Michaels. I bonded one of the mirrors on a small square thin sheet of cork board so that the mirror can sit flatly on the tablet without scratching its surface. I cut out a piece of elastic strap from an old suitcase, divided the strap into halves and attached one to two opposite sides of the mirror-cork contraption. Then I fixed few pieces of velcros to the strap ends so that I could tightly attach the mirror on to the surface of the tablet. I felt it was important to use an elastic band instead of a non-elastic strap because it would ensure a tight fit, and at the same time the velcro based attachment would be quite easy to untie after the alignment.</p>

<p>The following method may be used to ensure that the laser beam exactly passes through the small orifice in the frosted alignment disk attached to the front standard (lens plane):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/expt_psf_measurement_contraption_009.jpg" alt="Fig: Laser beam striking the alignment disk off-center. i.e. the beam doesn’t exactly fall on the opening" /><p class="caption"><em>Fig: Laser beam striking the alignment disk off-center. i.e. the beam doesn’t exactly fall on the opening</em></p>
</div>
<p>When the laser beam hits the disk off-center instead of exactly passing through the orifice the beam is scattered extensively, and the resulting speckle pattern can be seen by placing a small white sheet of cardboard in front of the front standard as shown in the next image.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/expt_psf_measurement_contraption_010.jpg" alt="Fig: Speckle pattern produced by scattering of the laser beam when it hits the alignment disk off-center." /><p class="caption"><em>Fig: Speckle pattern produced by scattering of the laser beam when it hits the alignment disk off-center.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Adjust the knobs (only vertical and horizontal displacements) of the front standard to place the laser beam at the orifice. As the laser spot on and near the orifice might be too bright to look at directly, observe the pattern on a white cardboard placed in front of the orifice. When the beam passed the orifice, I could see a “cleaner” spot on the board as shown below.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I could do even finer adjustment by observing the diffraction pattern (an Airy diffraction pattern) on a screen placed near the front standard as the laser beam propagated from the orifice to the mirror and back towards the orifice. The setup is shown in the following figure.</p>
<div class="figure">

<img src="images/expt_psf_measurement_contraption_013.jpg" alt="Fig: Diffraction pattern on the screen. Note that the pattern is somewhat distorted indicating that I could still get a better alignment of the front standard (orifice) to let the beam pass through cleanly." /><p class="caption"><em>Fig: Diffraction pattern on the screen.

<p>Now, we need to adjust the target’s orientation such that the reflected beam coincides with the orifice. The following figure shows the reflected beam hitting a region very close to the orifice.</p>

<p>The raw intensity data captured by the Sinar eVolution 86H digital back is stored in a Sinar-specific DNG file. DNG, which stands for “Digital Negative”, is an extension of the TIFF 6.0 format.</p>
<p>We exported the DNG files to TIFF images using CaptureShop. However, when I tried to read the TIFF files using either PIL (Python Image Library) or the <code>imread()</code> method from the <code>scipy.misc</code> module, I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>raise IOError(&quot;cannot identify image file&quot;)
IOError: cannot identify image file </code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>imread()</code> function from <code>scipy.misc</code> uses PIL to handle image file read/write; so it is not surprising that <code>imread()</code> fails.</p>

<h4 id="focusing-strategy">Focusing strategy</h4>
<p>We found that using one of the point source images for visually measuring the degree of focus/misfocus is a good option (at least in the rigid camera configuration). We could clearly see the blur spot when the point sources were not completely in focus as shown in the following image.</p>
<p><img src="images/FocusingStrategy_focusedvsd.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Notice, the shape of the misfocused spots. They are overall circular in nature; however, this is also a “hint” of a pentagonal ring, cause by the blades of the lens shutter.</p>
<p>For focusing in tilted plane orientation, currently we are using the following strategy:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using geometric calculations, estimate the tilt angle between image and lens standard required for a given tilt of the object plane</li>
<li>Follow the manual focusing strategy of sinar camera –</li>
</ol>
<p>[TO DO!!! update focusing strategy for scheimpflug case]</p>
<h5 id="standard-manual-focusing-strategy-of-sinar-p3-view-camera">Standard manual focusing strategy of Sinar P3 view camera</h5>
<p>The following section is “copied” from the Sinar manual.</p>
<p><em>The rear standard</em></p>
<p>Always establish the plane of maximum sharpness before stopping down.</p>
<p>With the rear standard (controls plane of maximum sharpness and perspective)</p>
<ul>
<li>Always set the standards vertically with the coarse tilt.</li>
<li>With the ﬁne focusing drive <strong>2</strong> sharply focus a suitable first image point on the horizontal axis <strong>H</strong> (or on the vertical axis <strong>V</strong> for a vertical axis swing.</li>
<li>With the micro meter drive <strong>3</strong> (or <strong>4</strong> for vertical axis <strong>V</strong> swings) focus on a suitable second image point - roughly opposite the ﬁrst - in the shaded area of the screen or live image.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The front standard</em></p>
<p>With the front standard (controls plane of maximum sharpness but not perspective)</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the plane of maximum sharpness with the rear standard as described above, then read off the tilt or swing angle. Direct tilting and swinging with the lens standard is not satisfactory as its optical setup always involves an overall sharpness shift.</li>
<li>Then turn the lens standard – in the same direction (+ or -) – to the same angle.</li>
<li>Return the rear standard to its zero engagement point.</li>
<li>Refocus with the ﬁne focusing drive <strong>2</strong> for maximum overall sharpness. Adjust the rear standard for any ﬁnal corrections to the plane of sharpness.</li>

<p>We collected some data in tilted plane configuration; However, it seems that the supposed orientation of the object plane was mis-represented. Additionally, there was also about a degree of positive tilt of the image plane w.r.t. the lens plane.</p>
<p>[TO DO: 1. Complete the description, 2. Contraption for measuring board tilt]</p>

<h3 id="a-closer-look-at-our-assumed-point-source">A closer look at our assumed “point source”</h3>
<p>I am trying to create a point source by turning on a <strong>single</strong> pixel of a surface pro 3 tablet [Refer to the code <code>\patterns_for_psf_measure.py</code> in under <code>code\exp_14_09_psf_measure</code>].</p>
<p>The following images show closeup view of the point source, taken with a high magnification lens. It is clear that I wasn’t really able to turn on EXACTLY ONE pixel!! It seems that 3 neighboring pixels are also turned on, albeit with much lesser intensity.</p>
<p>This can happen due to either of the two reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It might be possible, that I am making a mistake in the exact number of pixels in the display when I create the pattern array. I should test with a much smaller array, and see if I am able to turn on just one pixel.</li>
<li>It is possible, that even if I am creating a “good” source file that should have worked, the Surface Pro’s display driver is doing some sort of interpolation/scaling. To make the dot/line “look” larger. This is certainly a possibility. I must try to see if it is possible to disable auto-scaling of this window. I must also test this hypothesis by using the same code on a different display. If I am able to disable auto-scaling, and correct for this problem, then things will be great. Else, I might have to find a way to write directly into the display buffer.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite surprising to see the focused and misfocused spots have 
a highly circular shape, in spite of the above structure of the display pixels.</p>

<p>Using the scale, I was able to estimate the “size of a display-pixel” and the “size of a R/G/B color-site” in the following way:</p>
<p>(In the following section, I shall refer to the physical pixel size of the display that I am using as point-source as “display-pixel” and the pixel in the images as “image-pixel” to avoid confusion.)</p>
<p>I opened all the images in Adobe Photoshop, and measured the length of a millimeter in terms of the number of image-pixels, which as 637 image-pixels. Using the same scale, the length of a single display-pixel (containing R, G, &amp; B color sites) to be 75 image-pixels which corresponds to 117.74 microns. This is very close to 117 microns – the display-pixel size calculated from the PPI specifications of the display using back-of-the-envelope calculations (above). Dividing by 3, the width of an individual R/G/B element is about 40 microns. I also measured the height of an R/G/B photo-site to be about 94.2 microns.</p>

<p>As it turned out, it was the auto scaling on High DPI setting in Windows 8.1 (in my Surface Pro 3) that was causing this issue.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How does one ensure that the target rotates exactly through it’s intended central axis? Perhaps we must do some sort of “pose estimation” to estimate the axis of rotation of the plane.</li>
